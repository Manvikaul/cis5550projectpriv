            <p>Saturday last about One o’Clock a Fire broke out in Mr. Hamilton’s fine new Buildings near the Bridge; and the Wind being high, and the wood Work (which was unfinish’d) exceedingly dry’d by the long dry Weather, the whole was in Flames so suddenly and burnt so fiercely, that it was impossible to save any Part. The Loss is very considerable; and is generally regretted, as those Buildings when finish’d would have been a great Ornament to that Part of the Town.<a class="ptr" id="BNFN-01-02-02-0065-fn-0003-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-02-02-0065-fn-0003" title="jump to note 6">6</a> <span style="float:right;text-indent:0">[April 3]</span></p>

On Monday His Honour our Governor, attended by near 200 Gentlemen, came to the Court-House, where a vast Concourse of People were assembled, and published the King’s Declaration of War against Spain, together with the following Proclamation, viz.</p>

            <p>The People express’d their Joy in loud Huzzas; And the Cannon from the Hill, and the Ships in the Harbour, were discharged, while the following Healths were drank, viz.

Success to the new Levies, and intended Expedition, &amp;c. Plenty of Liquor was given to the Populace; and in the Evening they had a Bonfire on the Hill.</p>
            <p>As a Design against some of the rich Spanish Settlements appears exceedingly agreeable to the People in general, and there <a id="BNFN-01-02-02-pb-0284"></a>is truly a great Prospect of Success, it is not doubted but a considerable Body of Men will be raised on this Occasion, even in Pennsylvania.</p>
            <p>In our next we shall, from the Books of Geography, give some Account of those Countries against which it is supposed the present Expedition is intended. <span style="float:right;text-indent:0">[April 17]</span></p>

On Monday Morning he preach’d to about 3000 at Wilmington, and in the Evening arrived in this City; on Tuesday Evening he preach’d to about 8000 on Society-Hill; and preach’d at the same Place yesterday Morning and Evening.... <span style="float:right;text-indent:0">[April 17]</span></p>

He preaches here <a id="BNFN-01-02-02-pb-0285"></a>every Day this Week, and takes his leave on Sunday Evening. On Monday he preaches at Darby and Chester, where a Collection is to be made for the Orphan-House. On Tuesday at Wilmington by Ten a Clock precisely in the Morning; and at Whiteclay Creek at four in the Afternoon, where he intends to collect again. On Wednesday by Noon at Nottingham; and from thence he intends to return with all Speed to New-Castle, and to go on board in order to sail for Georgia. He cannot go so far as Dover and Lewis-Town, as proposed in our last, being obliged to hasten as fast as possible to Georgia, that he may have Time to go to New-England, and come from thence hither at the latter End of the Year.</p>
            <p>Those who are disposed to send Provisions or Money for the Orphan House, may send it to the House of Mr. Stephen Benezet Merchant, in Second Street.<a class="ptr" id="BNFN-01-02-02-0065-fn-0006-ptr" href="#BNFN-01-02-02-0065-fn-0006" title="jump to note 9">9</a></p>

            <p>During the Session of the Presbyterian Synod, which began on the 28th of the last Month, and continued to the third of this Instant, there were no less than 14 Sermons preached on Society-Hill to large Audiences, by the Rev.

English philanthropists contributed many kinds of goods, which Whitefield sold in Philadelphia for the benefit of the orphan-house, and he got generous financial contributions in the northern and middle colonies in 1739. Reaching Savannah Jan. 10, 1740, he rented a house, where he took in as many orphans as he could find (including some who were adequately provided for otherwise), and on a 500-acre tract ten miles away began the construction of a twenty-room building, an infirmary, and a workhouse. Whitefield himself laid the first brick March 25, naming the establishment Bethesda “because I hoped it would be a House of Mercy to many Souls.” Tyerman, <span style="font-style: italic">Whitefield</span>, <span style="font-variant: small-caps;text-transform:lowercase">I</span>, 347–52, 355.</p>

One, aware of the city’s needs and motivated by Christian principles and English examples, had in mind an elementary school where poor children might be instructed in “useful Literature and the Knowledge of the Christian Religion.” The other wanted a free house of worship for Whitefield, who had been barred from most of the churches in Philadelphia since April 1740. The two groups, wisely pooling their resources, named four trustees, who acquired a lot near Fourth and Arch Streets, began construction of a building, and in turn named nine “trustees for uses” to carry out the terms of the trust. <abbr style="font-variant: small-caps;text-transform:lowercase" title="Benjamin Franklin" class="tooltip">BF</abbr> was not a member of either group of trustees. Whitefield first preached in the unfinished building November 9, and used it regularly on subsequent visits to Philadelphia; other clergymen preached there; and Gilbert Tennent conducted services in it after 1743. Nothing came of the attempts to set up the charity school until 1750, when the trustees of the newly established Academy of Philadelphia acquired the building.</p>

            
   <p>Though the trustees of the New Building were of different faiths and the foundation was nonsectarian, the deed of trust made it clear that the charity school should offer Christian instruction and that the house of worship should be available only to Protestant ministers who were “sound in their Principles,... and acquainted with the Religion of the Heart and experimental piety.” Edward P.
